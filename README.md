# Runner

Beware of the peak of the mountains!

For this project, you will use C++ graphics with classes to create an interactive runner scene.

You may work individually or with a partner of your choosing.

## Setup

Use this Guided Project template to create a new repository (see [GitHub-with-CLion](https://github.com/uvmcs2300s2024/GitHub-with-CLion) repo for directions).
**Your repository must be named with the convention: Runner-netid**, where netid is your UVM NetID username.
* If you are collaborating, the format is Runner-netid1-netid2. Have one partner create the repository and give the other partner access on GitHub: on the repository page, go to the Settings tab, choose Manage Access, and add the person with their GitHub username.

Remember to commit and push frequently.

# Requirements

1. Complete the `Rect::isOverlapping` method (see TODO in rect.cpp).
2. Complete the TODOs in `engine.cpp`.

If you do it correctly, you should have a program that displays three rows of buildings gliding endlessly to the left. The user block should move with the mouse, making the buildings change color when overlapping with the user. If the user touches the peak of either mountain, or the user presses the escape key, the program should exit.

## Grading

If you are collaborating, both partners have to submit the project.

### Grading Rubric
- [ ] (2 pts) Correctly implement `Rect::isOverlapping`.
- [ ] (18 pts) Correctly implement the TODOs in `engine.cpp`.
